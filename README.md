# rubiks-cube-solver

This is a personal endeavour from my side after being inspired by a popular implementation of the the Korf's IDA* Algorith online. This project also contains the implementation of the good old BFS(Breadth First Search) and DFS(Depth First Search) algorithms along with the lesse known but interseting amalgamation of the two i.e IDDFS(Iterative deepening depth-first search) algorithm.
